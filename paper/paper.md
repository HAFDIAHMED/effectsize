# Aims of the Package

It is often of interest to to asses the size of an observed assosiation. This is typycally done to allow the judgment of the magnitude of an effect (especailly when units of measuemnt are not meanigful), to facilitate comparing predictors' importance within a given model, or both. Though some indecies of effect size, such a the correlation coefficiant (a standardized covariance coefficiant) are readly available, other measures are often harder to obtain. **effectsize** is an R-package [@rcore] that fills this important gap. Its primary goal is to provide utilities for estimating a wide variety of standardized effect sizes (i.e., effect sizes that are scale-invariant) and their confidence intervals (CI), from a variety of statistical models.
